# Quizzicle

A quizzicle app created purely with the React framework. 

## Purpose

The main reason of this project was to help me further hone my React skills and establish a better understanding of React and its various hooks by putting them into practice. 

## Working

The app works just like your typical Quiz app. 

- A total of five questions are fetched from an open third-party API, called the Open Trivia Database. 
- With the questions fetched, they are displayed on the screen and a user can choose an option from the provided four options. 
- The selected options are cross-referenced with the correct answer from the API call. 
- At the end, a score (total number of correct answers) is displayed on the screen along with a button that re-initiates the game.
